}}}
 
== Options ==
{{{
  -optimize       Merge geometries & polygons with similar properties to
                  reduce file & scene size
  -comments       Add comments about the object ids to the VRML file
  -center         Center the model around the first encountered points
                  (may be use to reduce z-fighting artifacts)
  -filter <mask>  CityGML objects to parse (default:All)
                  The mask is composed of: GenericCityObject, Building, Room
